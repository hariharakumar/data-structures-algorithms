Shasta provides medical, emotional, and spiritual support and care for terminal patients - those who have a prognosis of six months or less to live. We strive to enrich every moment of remaining life. We treat the person instead of the disease, focus on the family instead of just the individual, and emphasize comfort and quality of life.\r\n\r\nCertified Hospice Staff\r\n\r\nMercy Hospice Mt. Shasta is a licensed and certified hospice agency and part of Mercy Medical Center Mt. Shasta. We meet state, federal licensing, and certification requirements for The Joint Commission.  Medicare, Medi-Cal, and most private insurance plans cover hospice services. We rely heavily on community support to cover services for patients with no insurance or ability to pay. Financial support helps to cover the costs of specialty safety medical equipment and specialized comfort medications. \r\n\r\nOur Hospice Team\r\n\r\nWe have an entire team devoted to assist our hospice patients and their families. The Hospice Medical Director meets regularly with the hospice team to review the plan of care, pain management, and patient progress. These dedicated individuals have experience handling these difficult times with families. Our team includes:     \r\n\r\nâ¢ Dietician\r\nâ¢ Home Health Aide\r\nâ¢ Medical Director\r\nâ¢ Physical Therapist \r\nâ¢ Registered Nurse\r\nâ¢ Social Worker\r\nâ¢ Spiritual Care Support Coordinator \r\n\r\nThe Benefits Of Home\r\n\r\nAt Mercy Hospice Mt. Shasta, we feel that most patients are more comfortable in familiar surroundings. Hospice care is primarily based in the home, enabling families to remain together in peace, comfort, and dignity, and is provided by professional caregivers and volunteers. For patients without a caregiver, Hospice staff will make every effort to help set up a caregiving plan that may include friends, neighbors, or paid caregivers.\r\n\r\nFollow-up bereavement support is provided for surviving family members and caregivers. Support groups are offered throughout the year.","isActive":true,"imageUrl":null,"customIconImageUrl":"https://lbs-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/venues/5c2f7b4b-ebbf-4b1c-ad15-be907822376a/metadata/ad6b97ce388eeb19f7ea46d2cf138e77.png","x":0.0,"y":0.0,"isExit":false,"isAccessible":true,"portalId":"","level":1,"zoomLevel":5,"maxZoomLevel":5,"floorId":350363,"buildingId":71835,"annotation":null,"metaData":{"imageURL":"https://lbs-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/venues/c9a1e964-07cd-4313-a55a-910ac9b9ab04/metadata/f2cf80c7dd28a4a686c21636d46a05f2.png","keywords":"workforce,organization,staffing,talent,people,labor,labour,human, HR, employment, employee relations"},"createdAt":"2019-10-10T19:49:53Z","updatedAt":"2019-10-10T19:49:53Z","location":{"latitude":41.317603,"longitude":-122.319401},"externalId":50124373},{"id":50124374,"name":"Physical Therapy","poiType":16,"category":null,"description":"At Mercy Medical Center Mt.
